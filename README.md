# InkWell RAG Agent System

## 🤖 Overview

The InkWell RAG Agent System is a sophisticated AI-powered book creation agency that uses specialized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agents to handle different aspects of book writing and production.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Coordinator** - Master agent that manages the entire workflow
2. **Specialized RAG Agents** - Domain-specific agents with specialized knowledge
3. **Workflow Manager** - Handles the progression through different stages
4. **Integration Layer** - Connects with the InkWell platform

### Agent Team

- **Development Agent** - Character and world building
- **Research Agent** - Fact gathering and validation
- **Outline Agent** - Story structure and chapter organization
- **Writing Agent** - Content creation and writing
- **Editing Agent** - Quality control and editing
- **Cover Design Agent** - Visual design and cover creation
- **Audiobook Agent** - Audio production and narration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd agent-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Run the Agent System

```bash
python agent_coordinator.py
```

## 🔄 Workflow Process

### 1. Customer Request
- Customer submits book requirements
- Agent Coordinator receives request
- Project is created and workflow starts

### 2. Development Phase
- Development Agent creates characters and world
- Research Agent gathers facts (for non-fiction)
- Results are passed to next stage

### 3. Outline Phase
- Outline Agent creates detailed story structure
- Customer reviews and approves outline
- If approved, moves to writing phase

### 4. Writing Phase
- Writing Agent creates chapters
- Content is generated using RAG knowledge
- Human oversight ensures quality

### 5. Editing Phase
- Editing Agent reviews and improves content
- Grammar, style, and flow are checked
- Quality standards are enforced

### 6. Production Phase
- Cover Design Agent creates book cover
- Audiobook Agent produces audio (if requested)
- Final review and delivery
